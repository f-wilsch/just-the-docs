### Release of Major update v0.3.0 (2025-05-30)

The Matchete collaboration proudly announces version 0.3.0!

Matchete now supports automatic evanescent reduction. It is also possible to obtain the matching condition in a particular EFT basis (e.g., the SMEFT Warsaw basis) with `MapEffectiveCouplings`. These tools should make practical matching calculations easier than ever. The distribution now includes build in documentation (w.i.p.) using the Mathematica documentation framework (which can be accessed with the \`F1\` function key). Install this latest version to experience new features and many quality-of-life improvements.
