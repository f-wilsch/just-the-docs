## Installing and loading of the package

The simplest way to download and install Matchete is to run the following command in a Mathematica session:

> Import["https://gitlab.com/matchete/matchete/-/raw/master/install.m"]

This will download and install Matchete in the Applications folder of Mathematica's base directory. To load Matchete use the command:

> <<Matchete\`

The complete set of routines and usage examples can be found in the ancillary documentation notebooks. This repository also contains several example notebooks demonstrating the usage of Matchete for the one-loop matching of the following theories:
* Vector-like fermion toy model
* Singlet scalar extension of the SM
* Vector-like charged lepton singlet extension of the SM
